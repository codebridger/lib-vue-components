# Component library

We are two indie developers who love to build things. We are building a component library for vue and nuxt projects. it inspired by `vristo` and powered by `tailwindcss`.

You need to follow these principles in order to use the component library properly.

## AppRoot

All components should be wrapped with the main ancestor component called `AppRoot`.

```vue
<template>
  <AppRoot>
    <!-- your components here -->
  </AppRoot>
</template>
```
