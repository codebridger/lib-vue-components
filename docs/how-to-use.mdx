# Component library

We are two indie developers who love to build things. We are building a component library for vue and nuxt projects. it inspired by `vristo` and powered by `tailwindcss`.

You need to follow these principles in order to use the component library properly.

## AppRoot

All components should be wrapped with the main ancestor component called `AppRoot`.
It's really important to wrap all components with `AppRoot` because it's responsible for the global state management and the theme management.

```html
<App>
  <!-- your components here -->
</App>
```

```typescript
// Shell components
import { App, DashboardShell, ThemeCustomizer, SidebarMenu, HorizontalMenu } from '@tiny-ideas-ir/lib-vue-components/shell.ts';

// Element components
import { Button } from '@tiny-ideas-ir/lib-vue-components/elements.ts';

// Complex components
import { Modal } from '@tiny-ideas-ir/lib-vue-components/complex.ts';

// Type imports
import type { SidebarItemType, HorizontalMenuItemType } from '@tiny-ideas-ir/lib-vue-components/types.ts';
```

## Global Configuration
There is pinia store for global configuration. see full documentation [here](/docs/introduction.mdx#store)

```typescript
import { useAppStore } from '@tiny-ideas-ir/lib-vue-components/store.ts';

const appStore = useAppStore();
appStore.setTheme('dark');
```
