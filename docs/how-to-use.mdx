# Component library

We are two indie developers who love to build things. We are building a component library for vue and nuxt projects. it inspired by `vristo` and powered by `tailwindcss`.

You need to follow these principles in order to use the component library properly.

## LLM Friendly docs

You can use this doc for [llm](https://codebridger.github.io/lib-vue-components/llm.md) agents.

## AppRoot

All components should be wrapped with the main ancestor component called `AppRoot`.
It's really important to wrap all components with `AppRoot` because it's responsible for the global state management and the theme management.

```html
<App>
  <!-- your components here -->
</App>
```

```typescript
// Shell components
import {
  App,
  DashboardShell,
  ThemeCustomizer,
  SidebarMenu,
  HorizontalMenu,
} from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/shell";

// Element components
import { Button } from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/elements";

// Form components
import { Input } from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/form";

// Complex components
import { Modal } from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/complex";

// Type imports
import type {
  SidebarItemType,
  HorizontalMenuItemType,
} from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/types";
```

## Global Configuration

There is pinia store for global configuration. see full documentation [here](/docs/introduction.mdx#store)

```typescript
import { useAppStore } from "@codebridger/lib-vue-components/store.ts";

const appStore = useAppStore();
appStore.setTheme("dark");
```
